# MERN Library Management System

Welcome to the MERN Library Management System! This project is a full-stack application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to manage library resources efficiently.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization system to ensure data privacy.

1. **Backend:** Contains the server-side code built with Node.js and Express.js. It handles API requests, database interactions, and user authentication.

2. **Frontend:** Houses the client-side code developed with React.js. It provides the user interface for interacting with the library management system.

## Installation
